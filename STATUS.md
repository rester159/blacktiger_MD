# Status

Deliverable: an SGDK development cartridge and a reproducible new repository.
User's requested complete native Black Tiger port: **not achieved**.

The most important next work is source-derived actor/constructor coverage, not implementing another
round-specific runtime. The eight maps already use one renderer and game loop. Replace the heuristic
actor definitions/family behavior in `tools/extract.py` and `src/game.c` with verified animation,
attack, hitbox, reward, and transition data. In particular, do not count the current boss assignments
or injected ending test as proof that any round is naturally completable.

Known native issues: frame overruns on denser routes; unverified PAL timing; placeholder audio;
provisional player and shop rules. Exact cadence, cartridge hash, and test counts live in the JSON
reports and `dist/build.json`.

Resolved during this build: wrong-CPU libgcc, sprite-cache lookup cost, full-view cache pinning cost,
repeated HUD formatting cost, disappearing/stale background tiles caused by DMA queue overflow,
hero/font palette interference, and redraw batching on large camera changes.

Verified progress: the common actor animation loader is now a native typed routine with original-ROM
trace comparisons. All eight petrified NPC variants use source-derived constructors, idle frames,
rescue visuals, and distinct reward dispatch; actual-cartridge tests cover their persistence.
This does not validate other actor families, hint text, complete cutscene timing, or shop economics.

Remaining work order (shared systems, not sequential levels):
1. Prove constructor/template ownership and replace all heuristic enemy/boss definitions.
2. Implement source-derived player/combat, enemy families, containers, drops, and boss composition.
3. Match progression, shops, score, equipment, cutscenes, and natural round completion.
4. Replace placeholder audio, match presentation/palette behavior, and meet frame budgets.
5. Validate natural full-game routes and PAL/NTSC behavior; package only the tested cartridge.
